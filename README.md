# üõ∞ Cesium Certified Developer Project: Visualization of 3D Geofences and a 3D Network for Air-Taxis in New York city.

## üìò About the Project
**Project Objective:** 

This project aims to **realistically visualize the main three-dimensional components** derived from the research [*‚ÄúAn Adaptable and Scalable Least-Cost Network for Air Taxis in Urban Areas.‚Äù*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341173954_An_adaptable_and_scalable_least-cost_network_for_air-taxis_in_urban_areas_Study_area_Manhattan_New_York)  
Through the implementation of Cesium JS, the project provides a suitable environment to explore potential 3D routes for air taxis, Vertihubs, and Flight Restrictions based on real and existing regulations recommended by agencies, authorities, and designers of electric sandcraft of the eVTOL (Electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing) type.

**Specific Objectives:**

1. Visualize 3D geofences according to restriction orders, allowing different layers to be turned on and off in the geographic viewer.
2. Visualize the 3D route network for air taxis.
3. Allow the user to compare the different existing buildings with the estimated 3D geofences and 3D route network.
4. Visualize the route of an air taxi passing through different hubs along its way and following the generated 3D route.
5. Visualize a short air taxi route between some hubs (pre-emergency or normal situation).
6. Visualize the alternate route visualized in Objective 5 when a geofence exists due to an emergency (emergency situation).

**A little context:**
Back in 2019, my friend and colleague Moritz Hildemann and I developed a project for the GIS Applications subject at the Master's Degree in Geospatial Technologies, a project that addresses the challenge of designing air taxi routes in urban environments that are safe, efficient, and minimally disruptive to citizens, while respecting legal and practical constraints in three-dimensional urban airspace.

To better understand 3D geofences, they were grouped according to the POIs considered in the paper:

## üß© Data inputs and preliminary requirements
Before starting the development of this specific project, the following datasets, software, and libraries were required. Please note that most of the data used as inputs in this project were outputs obtained from the aforementioned paper published at the AGILE 2019 conference.

### üìÇ Data Requirements

## üíª Codebase

The project is composed of two main files:

- [`index.html`](./index.html) ‚Äî The main entry point of the application.  
  It initializes the Cesium viewer, loads styles and scripts, and defines the structure for the 3D visualization.

- [`geofence_proj.js`](./geofence_proj.js) ‚Äî Contains the core logic of the project.  
  It loads and renders GeoJSON data (geofences, vertiports, and flight paths), handles dynamic visual updates, and controls Cesium‚Äôs entity behavior during animations.

Both files work together to visualize air-taxi networks and their operational constraints in a realistic 3D environment using **CesiumJS** and **Cesium ION**.


## üé• Demo

Below are four short Loom videos demonstrating the main functionalities and visualization stages of the project.

1. **Initial 3D Geofences + 3D Route Network Visualization**  
   Demonstrates the integration of geofences at multiple restriction levels and the rendering of the 3D air-taxi route network across Manhattan.

4. **Air-Taxi Flight Tracking ‚Äì Short Route with Emergency Geofence**  
   Illustrates how an emergency geofence activates dynamically, forcing the system to recalculate and visualize an alternate flight path from one shown in the pre-emergency.
