# 🛰️ Cesium Certified Developer Project: <Project Title>

## 📘 About the Project
This project showcases an interactive 3D web application developed as part of the **Cesium Certified Developer Program**.  
It leverages **CesiumJS** and **Cesium ion** to visualize, analyze, and interact with real-world spatial data in a browser environment.

The goal of the project is to <briefly describe what your app does, e.g. “simulate solar access and shading over residential rooftops using 3D terrain and building models.”>

---

## 🧩 Data Processing
The project uses geospatial data sourced from <e.g. drone surveys, DSM/DTM rasters, CAD roof plans>.  
All data is processed before visualization to ensure correct geolocation and performance in CesiumJS.

**Workflow Overview:**
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Normalize DSM to ground level using DTM subtraction  
   - Extract roof or surface geometries using RANSAC/PCA methods  
   - Clean and simplify geometries with QGIS or GDAL  
2. **Conversion and Upload**
   - Convert geometries to GeoJSON or glTF formats  
   - Upload to **Cesium ion** for tiling as 3D Tiles  
3. **Integration**
   - Link processed datasets with metadata and load dynamically into the Cesium viewer
